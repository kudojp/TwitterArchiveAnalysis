    "> Twitter account 'WeRateDogs (@dog_rates)\" is famous for its unique tweets which evaluate dog pictures which are posted from readers. In this analysis, I got the tweets data from Twitter API and the additional data about pictures of those tweets and assess them. Specifically, I focused on 2 topics below\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * How the ratings are related with stages and types of dogs.\n",
    "> * Relationship between favorite counts and the ratings."

    "> It is easily predictable that tweets with high ratings are favored and also retweeted more and also that there is a strong positive correlationship between \"favorite\" counts and \"retweet\" counts. Actually it was true. I checked the relationship between these 2 counts and found that there is a positive correlationship.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So, in this project, I focused on \"favite count\" as one of the indicators of tweets' popularity among readers. The graph below represents the realationship between ratings written in the tweet and the tweet's favorite count. There can be found a positive correlationship between rating result and favorite accounts. This relationship is not completely explained by a linear model, as it clearly shows."

It was found that some dog types and stages tend to get higher evaluation than others, and more highly evaluated tweets can be favored by more people."
