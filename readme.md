# Twitter Archive Analysis
## by Daiki Kudo


This is a project from Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program Section4.  

Through this analysis, I get the tweets data of Twitter account ’WeRateDogs (@dog_rates)" from Twitter API and investigate the features of tweets which were highly evaluated from this popular dog rating account.   


## Analysis Overview  

Twitter account ’WeRateDogs (@dog_rates)" is famous for its unique tweets which evaluate dog pictures which are posted from readers. In this analysis, we get the tweets data from Twitter API and the additional data about pictures of those tweets and assess them. Specifically, we focus on 2 topics below
* How the ratings are related with stages and types of dogs.  
* Relationship between favorite counts and the ratings.
